This project implements a small part of an online sales system (such as Amazon.com).
The current project is concerned only with customer comments for sales items. It contains
code to create, store, show and manipulate customer comments.

NOTE: There are several serious errors to be found in these classes.


5.  If you enter either 0 or 6 since those numbers are outside the accepted value, then it returns false... therefore it means it wokrs orrectly.
9.  The code returns an error once you try to find the most helpful comment since none are added.
